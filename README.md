# TaskManagementAPI

This is a .NET core project running on .Net version 8, Entity Framework Core and PostgreSQL. The API provides user registration/login (JWT-based) and basic task CRUD(Create,Read,Update and Delete). The appsettings.json has all the important configuration entries from database connection, Jwt entries settings.

Essentials before you get started;
You need a Docker Application.
Pull the postgress Image in the docker Application by searching for it.
Once you have the postgres image , Execute the following commands in your docker terminal.
1.create a container for the application to hold the database which will be used in the this codebase.
docker run --name my-postgres \-e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=data \-e POSTGRES_DB=TasksDatabase \-v pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data \-p 5432:5432 \ -d postgres
Check your containers for my-postgres container to confirm it has been created
2.Execute docker ps to check if the container is running
Expected output is here
docker ps
CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES
c92244240228 postgres "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦" About a minute ago Up About a minute 0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp, [::]:5432->5432/tcp my-postgres 3. Install the client to enable you have access to psl by executing
sudo apt install postgresql-client -y
4.Execute psql -h localhost -U postgres -d TasksDatabase
5.Execute docker exec -it my-postgres psql -U postgres
6.Execute postgres=# \l (You will see a list of databases in your postgres)
7.Execute \dt to see the tables in the database in that container
8.select \* from "Tasks"; (if you have migrations executed already)

### Logging

Used Loggers to show the status of the applications when its running.
